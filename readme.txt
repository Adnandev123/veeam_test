sync_folders.py:
===============================================

This script contains a SyncFolders class that can be used to synchronize the contents of two folders. The class has a __init__ method that takes four arguments:

src: the source folder to synchronize
dst: the replica folder to synchronize with the source
interval: the synchronization interval in seconds
logfile: the file to log synchronization operations to
The __init__ method sets up the class instance with these four arguments and also creates the src and dst folders if they do not exist. It also sets up logging using the logging module.

The SyncFolders class has a sync_folders method that takes two arguments:

src: the source folder to synchronize
dst: the replica folder to synchronize with the source
This method compares the contents of the two folders using the filecmp module and synchronizes them by iterating over the files and folders in the src folder and:

Copying new files and folders from the src folder to the dst folder.
Updating modified files in the dst folder with the corresponding files from the src folder.
Removing files and folders from the dst folder that do not exist in the src folder.
The script also contains a block of code at the bottom that sets up command line arguments using the argparse module and creates a SyncFolders object using these arguments. It then enters an infinite loop where it synchronizes the src and dst folders every interval seconds using the time module's sleep function.


test_sync_folders.py:
===============================================

This script contains a test suite for the SyncFolders class defined in the sync_folders module. The test suite is defined by the TestSyncFolders class, which is a subclass of the unittest.TestCase class.

The TestSyncFolders class has four test methods:

test_same_folders: This test verifies that the sync_folders function does not make any changes to the folders if they are already synchronized.
test_src_empty: This test verifies that the sync_folders function removes files from the dst folder if they do not exist in the src folder.
test_src_has_new_file: This test verifies that the sync_folders function copies new files from the src folder to the dst folder.
test_src_modified_file: This test verifies that the sync_folders function updates modified files in the dst folder with the corresponding files from the src folder.
The TestSyncFolders class also has a setUp method that is run before each test case. This method creates a temporary directory and sets up the src and dst folders for testing. It also creates a SyncFolders object for testing.

The TestSyncFolders class also has a tearDown method that is run after each test case. This method deletes the temporary directory.
